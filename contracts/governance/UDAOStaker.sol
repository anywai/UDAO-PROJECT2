        Here is the explanation for the code above:
        1. First we check if the amount is greater than 0 or not. If it is 0 then throw an error.
        2. Second we declare 2 variables withdrawableBalance and vpBalance. withdrawableBalance is 
        the amount of udao that can be withdrawn and vpBalance is the amount of voting power that can be withdrawn.
        3. Then we loop over the governanceStakes[msg.sender] array and check if the lock is expired or not. 
        If it is expired then we check if the amount is greater than the lock.amount or not. If it is greater 
        then we add the lock.amount to the withdrawableBalance and lock.vpamount to vpBalance, and then we 
        remove the lock from the array. 
        3.1 If the amount is not greater then we calculate how much udao and 
        voting power can be withdrawn from the lock and then we reduce the lock.amount and lock.vpamount 
        by that much and then we add the udao and voting power to withdrawableBalance and vpBalance respectively. 
        And then we check if the _amount is less than or equal to withdrawableBalance or not. If it is then we burn 
        the voting power and transfer the udao to the user and then emit an event. If it is not then we revert with an error.
        4. If we reach the end of the loop and the _amount is still not less than or equal to withdrawableBalance then 
        it means that the user doesn't have enough withdrawable balance. So we revert with an error.
